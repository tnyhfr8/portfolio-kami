## Summary

The MVVM Framework is an important concept for any developer. Bloc Chat is a live chat room application designed to further my understanding of this framework through the combination of Angular and Firebase to provide a three-way binding with my HTML, Javascript, and the firebase database.

## Explanation

Bloc Chat is one of the many projects throughout the Bloc curriculum designed to introduce new ideas and reinforce old ones. The objective of this project was to build an application that could send and receive messages in real time. In this project i was introduced to Firebase and the Firebase Javascript and AngularFire API's. New tasks to further my education included Querying a Firebase array, creating a modal using UI Bootstrap, and using cookies for the first time.

## Problem

When building an application while being introduced to new tools and ideas such as databases (Firebase), Services ($firebaseArray), AngularJS Binding (AngularFire), and Repositories (UI Bootstrap) I run into 2 major problems. The first is being able to read the documentation and knowing which snippets of code i need to extract and which I do not, in order to get the desired effect in my application.

One example of this was when i was using a UI Bootstrap Modal for the first time. The link was supplied in the bloc checkpoint but when i arrived at the javascript for the first time it was quite confusing figuring out what was needed and what was not. (see below)

The second problem i had was the concept of “scope” and which one i was in or which objects I could access and why. The use of "this" added to this confusion during the development of this application.

## Solution

The solution to both my problems, and most likely all the issues I will come in counter with during my Bloc course was three-part. The first was reviewing the documentation. For this project I must have read the same paragraphs and code 10 times, and still sometimes didn't understand it. But each time I think I understood it a little bit better. Something that really helped was looking for an alternative definition or explanation when the first was not sinking in. The second was using tools like plunker or JS Bin to take code and play with it. See what lines did what task. It also helped me get rid of sections that I did not need for my specific goal. The third and final part was the reason that I decided to sign up for Bloc in the first place. The Mentors! My mentor Zach was of great help. Not just to show me the correct way but to show me why and how. Sometimes I just needed some help to really understand a new concept.

For my scope problem in particular I'd be remise if I didn't mention one specific piece of alternate explanation, an article on scope in JavaScript by Todd Motto. It was of great help and really made it much clearer for me.

## Results

The goal of this assignment was to use firebase to build an application that sends and receives messages in real time. With an overlaying emphasis on education. With this in mind I would say that the project was a success. I really learned a lot about firebase and three-way binding at every turn. It was also the first time that I had incorporated a modal.

While the application may lack a little in style I was definitely able to accomplish all that I set out to do functionality-wise. And if I can continue to build on the tools and skills that I learned with this project I am confident of the level that I will be at upon completion of the Bloc program.

## Conclusion

Half way through this project, as I was getting bogged down by self doubt and new information, I decided to slow down, to write my goals as they are presented to me in Bloc, and go through the list one by one. The answers and information is all there. They're in the documentation. They're in the stackoverflow comments, They're in the questions you ask to the mentor. What I take most from this project is the failures. Each time I failed and had to ask my mentor how to do something, there the answer was, right in the documentation and examples that I had been looking at. In the end both, Firebase, AngularFire, and UI Bootstrap are all great tools that I now know a lot more about.
