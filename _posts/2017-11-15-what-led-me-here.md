title: What Led Me Here
---
All my life I pushed the limits of my body. I played many sports. Any sport that I could find stiff competition. Soccer was my life for many years but I also played baseball and basketball for large chunks of time. Once it became more difficult to find big groups of people for games I looked elsewhere for challenges. I started to run long distances to really test my will to go through pain. After all, you don't need others to run. After I proved to myself that i could do it and realized that I didn't particularly enjoy it I moved to cycling. This i loved. It was a way to push myself and not need others. I also loved the exhilaration of flying down a mountain or hill. At this time I was also working at a construction company. I enjoyed working with my body and to be honest, the hard work. While working one day I had the idea to do a long distance bike ride. Canada to Mexico! Always looking for the next challenge right? Right. So after I trained and saved some money I was on my way. It was an absolute blast. It was an adventure and a half, not to mention extremely difficult. Here's me with my bike and the trailer that I carried all my supplies in.

Unfortunately that ride had, lets say lingering effects. Over time my knees have deteriorated (not all due to the ride), and I have been forced to change my lifestyle. I worked a few other jobs but eventually had to move to a more sedentary lifestyle and job. After fear of action and activity I slowly started to take little pieces of my life back. But to truly get back to a life that I will enjoy I will need to get away from the mundane office job I am currently at. It is far too repetitive and focused on the clock. What I do still love, even in different settings, is a challenge and a goal. The idea of a more project based career also excites me. After watching my college roommate build a life for himself with his computer science degree, I decided that I too could build a life for myself that much more resembles what I had in mind. Im here a little over halfway in my Bloc courses, trying to build a flexible, adventures, and exciting future.
