title: My Biggest Challenge
---
My biggest challenge comes from the aforementioned destruction of my body. Although I still quite normal, I'm usually in a decent amount of pain. Now this leads to two things that really get in the way of me progressing daily and meeting my goals with Bloc.

The first is that "thing" is that I really get worn down throughout the day. By the end of the day, the mental stress and physical toll that comes with what I have going on can really push me in the direction of just going to bed after work. This is not good, so I remind myself that everybody has a reason to not do extra work. That is why so many people are in jobs or living lives that they don't necessarily like. Its not always going to be easy. More recently, I've put in to practice a strategy to help with this issue. I try and start strong. What I mean by that is getting to work early and studying before work instead of after. It isn't easy to wake up that early but I feel more fresh and less worn down. This also includes trying to get more done in the beginning of the week. For the exact same reason. Freshness.

The second "thing" is that when the body is talking back to you it can be hard to stay focused. Its like someone talking in your ear the entire time you are trying to study. It really amplifies the frustration of failing to understand documentation or trying to find the error in your code. Theres not really a fix. With time the pain becomes more a part of normal life. But I would say that just an effort to keep coming back every time I'm forced to get up is key. Just keep coming back.
